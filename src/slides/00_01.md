With over 100 million developers, and more than 330 million repositories, GitHub is the largest developer platform in the world and all that code can be a big help to developers who are learning new skills.

Plus, At 275 repositories my personal library of code and my organization's 850 repos can be a challenge when I need to find that one piece of code or that one project I did a while back.

Thankfully GitHub has a new code search engine completely rewritten in Rust for performance and unbelievable speed. With feaures like regular expressions, boolean operations, auto-completions and a new code view that makes it easier to sort through results. I'll show you how you can search, understand and get to code faster and more efficiently than ever before.

Let's get started.
